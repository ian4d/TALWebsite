    "So listen, Tony. If the phone rings, take it in the back. And then come out and tell me who it is. Just say, Joe\u0027s being with a camera crew. Just for about 10 minutes. We\u0027ll do about five minutes, 10 minutes, right, Ira?",
    "I\u0027ve been called in many times to give a sort of a Dean, the elder statesman, even though I\u0027m still a young kid. But I\u0027ve been called in to give this kind of advice to new kids on the block. Conan O\u0027Brien had me on his first show. And people like that. There\u0027s no guidance. It\u0027s a matter of paying attention.",
    "I\u0027m ready.",
    "Your voice, I\u0027ve heard so much about the sparkle, about the energy in your voice. The voice, on radio especially, is everything. And when the guest is sitting with you, you\u0027ve got to look into his eyes. Many times, you get an author on there who\u0027s begrudgingly sitting there. He\u0027d rather be home in his ivory tower.",
    "And above all, get the plug fast. Otherwise, he\u0027s worried you\u0027re not going to make the plug for the book. And I created a line, Ira, that\u0027s been picked up by George Burns. I always said, the main ingredient for longevity in the talk show field, where the mortality rate is so staggering, the main ingredient is sincerity. And once you learn to fake that, then you got it made. I made that up. And I just played it by ear. I was a natural born talker, I guess.",
    "That\u0027s the key. And don\u0027t look in their nose or their belly button. Look right in the eye. Eye contact is everything. And as I say, it\u0027s a lot of fun.",
    "And I never called anybody in my life to come on to my show. And I\u0027m sure that they\u0027ll be coming to you too. I heard about you, and I called you and wanted to wish you good look, Ira. Imagine the thrill of John F. Kennedy walking into my studio. Richard Nixon. Ronald Reagan, five times. And Bing Crosby.",
    "And I\u0027ve got a major book out right now, by the way, Ira, called Up Late with Joe Franklin from Simon \u0026 Schuster. And if you find a copy in the store--",
    "See, that is my fault. I got it in toward the bitter end. It\u0027s like Duke Ellington. He always used to have his dessert at the beginning of the meal. Duke Ellington said, because he would never have no room for it at the end. So he had his dessert at the beginning. Who is it? Well, no, good news, 6 o\u0027clock.",
    "Ira, I\u0027m going to be a listener and a fan. And let\u0027s always be in touch.",
    "[MUSIC - \"DESTINATION MOON\" BY DINAH WASHINGTON]",
    "Oh, you\u0027re the emcee on the show, Ira.",
    "Oh great. Ira? I-R-A, Ira?",
    "Oh, great. Now hold on one second, Ira. Don\u0027t go away. Hello? [UNINTELLIGIBLE]. Call me after 3 o\u0027clock. I have great news for you. Ira.",
    "Look right in the eye. Eye contact is everything.",
    "Above all, get the plug fast.",
    "Look right in the eye. Eye contact is everything."
