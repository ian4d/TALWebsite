    "Shut up, kid.",
    "[SLAP]",
    "Yeah, Pete. The kid can take it. Now give me three.",
    "5,000.",
    "A pair of 9\u0027s. Dondi?",
    "Those are spades, not onions. And you\u0027re supposed to match the numbers, not the suit, you little spaghetti sucker.",
    "You have garbage. How many times do we have to go through this? It\u0027s like rolling a boulder up a hill just to have it roll back down again, over and over and over.",
    "Don\u0027t call me sahib. Peter, what do you have? A pair of jacks. All right. Pair of jacks takes it. All right. Seven card stud poker, one-eyed royalty, red deuces, nines, and all odd-numbered clubs are wild.",
    "Call.",
    "What do you got?",
    "So do I. All right, so there were a few too many wild cards. Let\u0027s hold the pot over.",
    "Sure, Pete.",
    "Good idea. What is it, Pete? Think the kid\u0027s trying to hustle us?",
    "What\u0027s the matter?",
    "What? Why?",
    "That\u0027s ridiculous, Pete. You\u0027re a very nice guy. You write letters. I never write letters.",
    "Is that it? You betrayed somebody and then didn\u0027t feel any remorse? Is that what all those pregnant pauses during the poker banter were about?",
    "How can you say you don\u0027t have any remorse when you\u0027re practically tearing your hair out worrying about going to hell?",
    "And you don\u0027t feel sorry at all?",
    "Even though you recognize that what you did was wrong?",
    "You know, Pete, you\u0027re a very complex guy.",
    "Dondi, what\u0027s with the old lady?",
    "Well, shut her up, will you? I can hardly hear myself think.",
    "Maybe to see the Pope?",
    "Go see the Pope. Ask for absolution.",
    "You could just act repentant. That\u0027s what ritual is all about, going through the motions.",
    "That is a very rigid attitude.",
    "You haven\u0027t even tried. I mean, the Pope\u0027s a very nearsighted, distracted old man. If you buried your face in your hands and pretended to sob, I\u0027m sure he\u0027d buy it.",
    "You know, I\u0027m starting to think that you don\u0027t really want to help yourself.",
    "A peacock.",
    "Pride. Look, there it is, in the middle of the cemetery.",
    "[PEACOCK CRY]",
    "My advice is that you come up with the most positive interpretation you can.",
    "Aww.",
    "We know what the game is, you little pistachio masher.",
    "Don\u0027t give me that bluffing baloney. You got a possible straight flush in onions.",
    "Don\u0027t call me sahib.",
    "I\u0027ll call.",
    "Three 10\u0027s.",
    "Ooh. What do you got, kid?",
    "You got nothing.",
    "My grandpa used to call that a kangaroo straight.",
    "No, Klondike doesn\u0027t win the game. Peter wins the game. Full house wins.",
    "Anything wild?",
    "Shut up. Ow. Watch it with those cards, man.",
    "What\u0027s your problem today?",
    "He\u0027s got you there. 10,000 lira.",
    "Hell, no. I believe in damnation, though.",
    "Predestiny. Take me. I was born damned. I\u0027m cowardly, petty, intolerant, lazy, and just generally destructive. I knew I was damned the first time I heard the word."
