    "Joe Franklin?",
    "That\u0027s right.",
    "So let me just summarize what I\u0027m getting from you. You\u0027re saying you should just pay attention, look people in the eye, be sincere when I\u0027m on the air, get in the plug early.",
    "You see now, I guess I\u0027ve sort of messed that one up, because I didn\u0027t let you get in your plug early.",
    "Well, Joe Franklin, thank you very much for being with us on our premier show.",
    "It\u0027s Ira Glass here.",
    "I am the emcee on the show. Yes.",
    "Ira, I-R-A.",
    "Yes.",
    "All right, Your Radio Playhouse. All right. I\u0027m making eye contact with you right-- wait, how does Joe put it? Wait a second.",
    "I am making eye contact with you right now. That is just how much I have already learned. OK, so the thing about new beginnings is that there are the ones that we actually undertake and then there are the ones that we just wish for. And the ones that we wish for pretty much outnumber the ones that we really undertake.",
    "Well, Kevin Kelly spent most of his twenties wandering around Asia. He was basically wandering around as a freelance photographer. And he found himself photographing a lot of religious ceremonies and drawn to religious ceremonies of all sorts. And he says that he was really confused about what he believed. And he was the kind of person who had always dreamt about a new beginning, where he wouldn\u0027t struggle with these questions.",
    "We will not attempt to answer these questions, by the way, in this hour. I just want to just give you a sense of scope here, just modest scope. But what we want to talk about is what happened to Kevin Kelly. What happened is that at the age of 27, all of this changed when he came into Jerusalem on the eve of Easter and Passover. It was the same weekend. And flocks of people are coming into the city.",
    "Does that make sense? You look at them, and you think, \"I wonder if he gave me that $1,000?\" And then you act really nice to him. And then the next person you see, the next of your friends, you think, \"Could this be the person?\" And then you act really nice to them.",
    "I almost want to begin a little speech here about let us all now take up this practice. All of us. Everyone within the sound of my voice. If we all could just do this right now, then I would believe that our little radio show, just 19 minutes into the program, had contributed in some way.",
    "Well, Kevin Kelly is 43 now. That happened when he was 27. In his latest rebirth, he is the executive editor of Wired magazine, a glossy magazine about the future and the present. He told us that he wasn\u0027t even sure he has ever even told his parents this story, even this many years later. Anyway, he spoke with me and Paul Tough from the studios of KQED in San Francisco. This is Your Radio Playhouse on WBEZ Chicago.",
    "Sure.",
    "You are such a pro.",
    "Artsy.",
    "Are you and Dad still worried about me making a living in public radio? I know just for years, you were urging me to just get out and get, basically, any job in TV that I possibly could. But now that I\u0027ve got my own show, are you guys still worried? Or do you feel like things are going OK? Do you want me to get into television still?",
    "All right. I\u0027m stopping the tape. This is me live. That was the tape. Only my mother could possibly believe this. Only a mother could pretty much believe this. Other adults see me, and the thought that goes through their head is not Hugh Grant. The thought that goes through their head is tall Jew.",
    "All right. Yeah, let\u0027s move on.",
    "The theme for this week is new beginnings. And we have several stories, people telling about various ways in which their life began anew at some point.",
    "I\u0027m just going to stop the tape again. This is my whole life. I call my mom for an interview, and it\u0027s not even her first interview of the day. I was lucky to get a booking. She\u0027s a therapist, and sometimes she gets called by the papers and stuff.",
    "Which means what?",
    "All right. I\u0027m just going to stop the tape. Listen, all of you in the audience right now, let\u0027s just agree right now, it\u0027s the very beginning of our relationship. It\u0027s the very beginning of our radio relationship right now. This is our little first little radio date, and I just don\u0027t want any idealizing on either side. OK? Let\u0027s just make eye contact right now. Remember what Joe Franklin said about the eye contact. No idealizing.",
    "It\u0027s interesting that you say that because, actually, as we\u0027ve approached the first show, I\u0027ve realized that I am much more comfortable with the notion of every day, work-a-day radio work, and being on every week, and having pieces on the air. But the notion of saying in a really big way, \"OK, this is the beginning. It\u0027s the beginning, and we\u0027re going to have a big beginning, and we\u0027re going to make an epic statement,\" I feel very uncomfortable with.",
    "I\u0027m better, I think, at middles than at beginnings.",
    "We have gotten so deep here. I never expected that it was going to get so deep. I\u0027m just very pleased at how deep this has gotten. Now you\u0027re sitting there, you\u0027re thinking, \"Is he making fun of me? What\u0027s happening now? Where are you?\" No, I\u0027m not. I\u0027m not, actually. I\u0027m not. I\u0027m not. I\u0027m not. You have nothing to worry about.",
    "Depending on how you sound, yeah.",
    "Well, that\u0027s my mom, Shirley Glass, speaking to us from Baltimore. I don\u0027t think she\u0027s going to get a tape. I do not think she\u0027s going to get a tape.",
    "Hey, is Barry there?",
    "Is Barry there?",
    "It\u0027s his son.",
    "Isn\u0027t this starting to sound like-- this little dialogue-- isn\u0027t it starting to sound like an episode of Dr. Katz? You know that TV show? \"This is his son.\" \"Uh-huh. Yeah.\" Anyway, so I thought I would call my parents in Baltimore and ask for advice on this, our first evening of our brand new radio show, Your Radio Playhouse.",
    "Can I leave a message with you? Or is it better to use his voicemail?",
    "OK, let\u0027s do.",
    "This is the story of my childhood right there. Dad is a little too busy to talk. But there\u0027s the recording of Frank Sinatra when needed.",
    "[TELEPHONE RINGING]",
    "Hey, Mom.",
    "How you doing?",
    "Sure.",
    "This is what it\u0027s like with my parents. They\u0027re so busy. Call them. Put on hold. [SINGING] Baby, what\u0027s your hurry?",
    "When I call my little sister, she works at Disney, and so there\u0027s Disney music playing on the hold system. But there\u0027s a lot of Disney music. And there\u0027s a lot of it that peo--",
    "Hi, Mom.",
    "It\u0027s me.",
    "Listen, can I record a quick conversation with you about something?",
    "Well, you know the new show goes on the air this week. And as part of the show, we were thinking about having me call around to different people and get advice from them. And I wanted to know if you would have any advice.",
    "Well, next on our little playhouse stage, we have Mr. Lawrence Steger. Now those of you who have been listening carefully to our program and taking notes, and I know there are many of you out there, you know what I\u0027m supposed to do at this point. You know because you were listening carefully to Joe Franklin at the very beginning of our program.",
    "That\u0027s right. Well, thank you, Joe Franklin. Lawrence Steger is a filmmaker and a performance artist, just back from performing in Glasgow, Scotland. He\u0027s going back there in January to collaborate with the performance artist, Ron Athey, who lives here in Chicago. And basically, we contacted Lawrence, and we told him the story that you heard over the course of the last half-hour, Kevin Kelly\u0027s story, this guy who believes he only has six months to live, goes on this cross-country road trip.",
    "And as it turned out, when Lawrence Steger found out, the day that he found out that he was HIV positive, this was five years ago, on that day, it was the exact day that he and a friend left on a cross-country car trip. So we commissioned him to do a little piece about his experience. And here it is.",
    "Yeah, sure. Just pull that.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Well, Lawrence Steger is a Chicago performance artist and filmmaker.",
    "This is Your Radio Playhouse. I\u0027m Ira Glass. OK, what am I doing right now? What am I doing right now? That\u0027s right. That\u0027s right. Eye contact.",
    "That\u0027s right. Advice from the master. OK. Let\u0027s review our program so far. Let\u0027s just review. Let\u0027s just get things straight right now. Our stories so far have been about people whose futures were taken from them and were thrown into the present in one way or another.",
    "I guess when any big emotional moment happens, you are thrown in the present in a really aggressive, aggressive way, whether you choose to or not. You have this hyper sense of reality. Well, the next story is about someone whose future was taken from him when he was wrongly imprisoned for 20 years. And his sentence was commuted two years ago. And he found himself reborn into everyday life.",
    "This is Ed Ryder. He was in prison for murder and was doing time in Graterford Prison in Pennsylvania. And a few years ago, a key witness who had testified against him admitted to lying while under oath, and other evidence came forward. He was made a free man. Back when he was in Graterford Prison, he played trumpet, and he sang with a jazz band. And that whole time, he dreamed of this new life, a new life that he would have outside as a professional musician. And that\u0027s what he\u0027s working on. That\u0027s what he\u0027s working on right now. And he\u0027s playing. He doesn\u0027t have a CD yet, but he\u0027s playing gigs in the real world.",
    "Now you know how we heard people earlier in the program talk about the importance of living in the present. But when we interviewed Ed Ryder, he pointed out that, in prison, the most important thing is to keep your eye on the future, on the day that you\u0027re going to get out. And that the guys who just live in the present do really badly, because, of course, the present is so terrible.",
    "We asked him if he is still playing the same music now that his future is here and he\u0027s out. And we thought that maybe the songs that he used to play would just bring back these hard memories of prison that he\u0027d rather just as soon avoid. But he said, no, he plays the same numbers now that he used to, though sometimes they mean something different to him today.",
    "Ed Ryder joining us in the playhouse from the studios of WHYY in Philadelphia, speaking with me and associate producer Nancy Updike. Ed Ryder\u0027s a big Billie Holiday fanatic. That was the word he used, \"fanatic,\" when we asked him about it. So when we asked him to play a number with his horn, with his trumpet, he played \"Lover Man.\"",
    "[MUSIC - \"LOVER MAN\" BY BILLIE HOLIDAY]",
    "That\u0027s pretty much all the time we have for this evening.",
    "[FUNDING CREDITS]",
    "OK, three boys, aged 13, 15, and 16. All three chose to appear with fake names on this radio program. And the fake names they chose, you ready? K-Rad, Mr. Warez, and Fred. Those first two names come from the world of computer hacking and software piracy. Mr. Warez, for example, that\u0027s \"warez,\" as in \"wares,\" as in \"softwares,\" as in pirated softwares, illegal softwares. And as for Fred--",
    "I think it\u0027s fair to say that one sign that your criminal career is not going so well is if you have to worry about the prices at McDonald\u0027s. But K-Rad, Mr. Warez, and Fred were involved in very low-level types of crimes. All of them involve computers. They pirated software. They scammed free CD-ROM games. They cheated one of the big online computer services out of a few hundred dollars in online time.",
    "All in all, they didn\u0027t steal very much. And they didn\u0027t steal very effectively. But they did try to steal. Take this phone scam, where they would call people at random and try to get a calling card number or a credit card number out of them.",
    "And that, of course, is the idea behind the whole thing, to end up with a calling card number or a credit card number that is not your own, that you can use yourself. Now I should say that before you go out and try this yourselves, if you are thinking about doing this yourself right now, I should tell you one important fact. It doesn\u0027t work.",
    "The other scams these guys run don\u0027t do much better. They tried to hack their way into the mainframe system of a big computer retailer. But they were caught and stopped before they got very far. They are such unaccomplished computer hackers that Fred himself was actually the victim of computer hackers twice. Someone broke into Fred\u0027s account on one computer bulletin board and used his account and his electronic mail to visit some of the nether regions of the net.",
    "Over the summer was when they really started to get serious about using other people\u0027s credit cards, which they call \"carding.\" They met a guy who was good at this and who taught them some tricks. K-Rad and Fred ordered $1,600 in computer merchandise on someone else\u0027s credit card. They had it delivered to a neutral address. They picked it up. They sold half of it for cash.",
    "And one thing that\u0027s peculiar about this story is that these are rich kids. K-Rad and Fred live in a wealthy upstate community. They attend what is one of the most expensive, prestigious private schools in the country. But they steal.",
    "Fred believes that he has no choice. He really suffers over money. He\u0027s this skinny, young-looking 15-year-old. And he is perpetually strapped for cash. And he said that his parents couldn\u0027t help him much with money right now because they had just gone $500,000 into debt.",
    "At one point, to get some cash, he actually sold the computer that his parents had bought for him. And I don\u0027t think they knew. His idea is that he wanted to replace the computer as quickly as he could with the help of a stranger\u0027s credit card.",
    "And he also wanted to get all the other things that the other kids at his expensive private school had. He wanted to have a microwave. He wanted to have a stereo. Basically, he just wanted to be like everybody else.",
    "You see, anonymity was important given the kinds of things that we were discussing, namely credit card fraud, computer hacking, and the nature of hell. Well, from WBEZ in Chicago, this is Your Radio Playhouse. I\u0027m Ira Glass. Today on our playhouse stage, small-scale stories of small-scale sin. Stay with us, won\u0027t you?",
    "What\u0027s striking about this is how these boys want to convince themselves-- I think they really do-- want to convince themselves that they are good, and that what they do does not harm anyone. And if it does harm someone, there\u0027s always the reassuring thought that they keep very near at hand that someday they can make it up to the injured party.",
    "K-Rad told me that the $1,600 that they charged to a stranger\u0027s Visa card was, in fact, a victimless crime, that the card owner would call Visa, have the charge removed from his bill. And that Visa figures a certain amount of fraud is just the cost of doing business.",
    "That\u0027s one of my favorite parts of the interview. Hold on. I\u0027m just going to play that tape back. Because you can actually hear him-- he\u0027s struggling so much, you can actually hear him working it out out loud. Hold on, I\u0027m just going to rewind for a second.",
    "[TAPE REWINDING]",
    "See what I mean? So we headed out of the McDonald\u0027s and back to the hotel where the computer hackers\u0027 convention was taking place. On the way, without any prompting at all, Fred elaborated on the idea that he was only stealing because he absolutely had to.",
    "So K-Rad, Mr. Warez, and Fred were trying to be criminals. But they were not too successful at this. And at a McDonald\u0027s on Times Square in New York City, they told all. Doesn\u0027t that have a nice, Hard Copy sound to it? \"They told all.\"",
    "Talk about that part of it. What is the thrill of doing it?",
    "By this point, we were back in the hotel lobby. We took the elevators up to the floor where the hackers\u0027 convention was taking place. K-Rad said that real hackers do not use their skills like this. They do not use their skills for personal gain. They don\u0027t do carding. They don\u0027t steal.",
    "The whole idea of computer hacking, for these guys anyway, is that it\u0027s a kind of pure, zen pursuit. It\u0027s an ends in itself. You break into the computer for its own sake and to look around, and for the knowledge of everyone, especially you.",
    "We stood in the hallway. People streamed by. We tried to move to a corner where we would not be overheard. And K-Rad said, actually, that they had never really talked about their illegal activities this much before with anyone.",
    "Fred then shot him this look. Because if K-Rad were serious, and they did stop carding, Fred would not be able to get a computer to replace the old one that his parents gave him.",
    "This was kind of an unpleasant McDonald\u0027s. Because it was in Times Square, they decided to have neon lights everywhere in this place. A crush of sweaty people at the counter, tourists, most of us. It was the middle of summer. Fred took charge.",
    "The thing about a bad conscience is that it splits you in half. And Fred said that he had two different modes. That was the word he used, \"modes.\" He said that sometimes he would think about what they were doing. And he knew it was wrong, and it would bother him. But mostly, he tried not to think about it.",
    "Do you believe in hell?",
    "And you think you can go to hell for getting a computer on somebody else\u0027s credit card?",
    "How big is this worry? Will this keep you up at night?",
    "His share of the carding profits was $800. I told him that from an adult\u0027s perspective, this did not seem like a lot of money. I didn\u0027t think you could do eternity in hell for $800.",
    "And as soon as I said this, I really regretted it. Fred\u0027s body language changed completely. It was like I was calling him a little kid. It was like saying that he was ridiculous to worry over something so small. It was just one of these moments. He got quieter, and he kind of pulled into himself a little bit.",
    "Then Mr. Warez spoke up. He said that sure, maybe by adult standards, this wasn\u0027t much money. But to them, it was a lot, that it was plenty enough to count.",
    "When is hell a possibility? Whenever you think it is, it is. More on this when our program continues.",
    "They\u0027re actually in Manhattan for a computer hackers\u0027 convention this summer, and Fred was not used to the downtown prices.",
    "Well, \"The Golden Peacock\" was written for Your Radio Playhouse by Jeff Dorchen. Jeff also played Caleb. Peter Handler played Peter. Lisa Stodder played Dondi and played the dying grandmother.",
    "Well, this is Your Radio Playhouse. Now a little radio experiment. We told a Chicago playwright named Jeff Dorchen what K-Rad, Fred, and Mr. Warez said about hell and about sin and about their own relative badness in this world. And we asked Jeff Dorchen to write an original radio play that would pick up the themes where the boys leave off. So here\u0027s what he came up with.",
    "How bad is bad? How bad is bad enough to count to send you to hell? Well, Michael Warr is a local poet and director of the Guild Complex here in Chicago. And he joins us in this, our radio playhouse.",
    "And Michael, you were raised with certain, very particular ideas about when a sin was bad enough to actually count.",
    "Now, you\u0027ve brought some of your poems about your experience with these rules. And they\u0027re here. Actually, you\u0027re a very modern poet, and you\u0027ve brought your color Macintosh, portable Macintosh, here. Why don\u0027t we flip it on?",
    "It\u0027s on.",
    "Do you think that it\u0027s only possible to be heavily engaged in these issues, or it\u0027s much easier to be heavily engaged in these issues, when you are young? That is, I was talking to this guy about this. And he told me this story about how when he was a kid, not even a teenager yet, he stole a cheap little tin toy car of a kind his parents never would have bought him that he shoplifted out of a dime store.",
    "And he said he felt such a profound guilt about the wrongness of this that he could never play with it in good conscience. He could never play with it. And eventually, he just threw it away. He just threw it in the garbage because he thought it was so wrong. And I wondered if you think that our sense of right and wrong is much bigger, our awareness of it, the internal debate about what is right and wrong, is much more acute when we\u0027re kids.",
    "The Witnesses [INAUDIBLE].",
    "Michael Warr, thank you for coming into our radio playhouse and reading for us.",
    "Michael Warr is the author of We Are the Black Boy. More thoughts about sin, sinning, what\u0027s wrong, what\u0027s not wrong, when our radio playhouse, my radio playhouse, Your Radio Playhouse continues.",
    "This is Your Radio Playhouse. Small Scale Sin on today\u0027s program. I\u0027m Ira Glass.",
    "So Eli was a big-time computer hacker. He and his friends were thrown into prison for this. He served six months. And here\u0027s what he says about his time in the big house.",
    "I think a lot of people are going to hear this and feel a certain horror. They\u0027re going to feel like, well, people should be punished.",
    "This is a story of someone who does not fear hell or punishment. It\u0027s a story of somebody who\u0027s been put into the position of defining for himself what is right and what is wrong. Starting in the mid-1980s, Eli was a member of a crew of computer hackers called MOD. At the time, journalists from the Village Voice and Esquire magazine documented just how much they were able to do.",
    "It is entirely possible that no group of American computer hackers has before or since gotten so far in breaking into other people\u0027s computers. They infiltrated dozens of business and government networks. The reporters from Esquire, at one point, asked them to demonstrate their skills by breaking into the White House computer system. And then they watched them do it.",
    "But for MOD, their real love was the biggest, most complicated computer system in the world, the phone system. They were in at the highest level computers that run the phone system for New York and New England. And this way, they could assign any services to any phone, listen to any phone, disconnect or create accounts, get unlisted phone numbers, or bring the entire phone system down.",
    "Eli served six months in a minimum-security prison and six months on home confinement. I spoke with him this summer, while he was still on home confinement in his parents\u0027 house in Queens.",
    "Outside, in the hacking community, Eli was pretty well known. Actually, he was known by his handle, which was Acid Phreak. That\u0027s \"Phreak\" with a P-H at the beginning of it. Inside, in prison, he got all sorts of job offers. It turns out that lots of people in prison can use the services of a computer hacker.",
    "Well, actually, it was only sort of typical. The bedroom that he lives in during his six-month home confinement is tiny, barely enough space for a bed, a desk, and a bookshelf. There\u0027s a TV and a VCR, two computers. He flips on the stereo.",
    "There were cheesy kung fu movies on video. On his CD player, there was old-school rap, Nine Inch Nails, the Doors, Jimi Hendrix. And then he says, \"Let me show you the good stuff,\" and he pulls out Xeroxes of old spiral notebooks.",
    "The something defense? What is that?",
    "Government defense.",
    "So did you decide just at random to help someone out?",
    "Login would just appear, whoomp. Input password, whoomp.",
    "If anything, it\u0027s surprising how little they did with their power over computers. It was mostly pranks, making somebody\u0027s phone ring continuously, turning an enemy\u0027s home phone line into a pay phone line so when the guy picked up his phone at home, it demanded that he deposit a quarter. Of course, there was no way he could do that because it\u0027s his home phone.",
    "They did actually call Julia Roberts once. They called Queen Elizabeth, too. But there\u0027s an emptiness at the heart of a lot of these stories. Once you\u0027ve got the Queen on the phone, what do you say?",
    "Eli was thrown into prison for a relatively minor offense. Some of the members of his crew broke into the computers that list everybody\u0027s credit ratings. And they copied some credit reports. And they sold the information to other people. And he was named as a member of this conspiracy.",
    "One thing about the computer world is that it\u0027s all so new. And hacking on computers is so new that each person who does it feels like he or she can create his or her own moral code. And Eli\u0027s crew had its own particular code of behavior. For example, unlike most hackers, they didn\u0027t share what they knew with other hackers.",
    "It is because of their own moral code in their group, and also their belief that someday hacking will no longer be seen as a crime, that society will change its ideas about information and computers and breaking into computers, that Eli is able to say something like this next quote about his time in the big house.",
    "In fact, when I was visiting Eli, he was facing a daily question of right and wrong when it came to his own home confinement. The prison system was keeping track of him during home confinement with this electronic device. It was about the size of a beeper. It was riveted onto an ankle strap.",
    "And it would send this signal to a computer that authorities had put into his house. And that computer would call another computer any time that he would leave the house. And as he explained, hacking these computers and the phone line that connected them was pretty easy work.",
    "But he did not do it. He said he just didn\u0027t want to get in any more trouble. He said he was going straight. And it wasn\u0027t because he thought hacking was wrong. It was that he was just tired of it.",
    "Now, though he was burned out, it was still a shock when the federal authorities seized all of his computers and he wasn\u0027t allowed to hack anymore. This was back when he was first arrested.",
    "Well, Acid Phreak was not the first criminal who told me that he quit being bad because he got bored with it. A few Chicago gang members have told me the same thing, that you end up having the same night over and over again. You just get tired of it.",
    "Maybe you remember the book A Clockwork Orange, the book and the movie. They\u0027re about teenage boys who love ultra-violence, commit murder, do all sorts of horrible things, speak to each other in a very stylized language.",
    "At the end of that book-- the movie actually doesn\u0027t end this way, but the original British edition of the novel does. At the end of the book, the central character gives up committing acts of violence. And it\u0027s not because he thinks it\u0027s wrong. And it\u0027s not because any of the punishments and treatments that he\u0027s received have worked on him.",
    "He gives it up because he\u0027s bored with it. It\u0027s just not that interesting to him. And we will end our program today with a couple of paragraphs from the book.",
    "\"I knew what was happening, O my brothers. I was like growing up. Yes yes yes, there it is. Youth must go. Ah, yes. But youth is only being in a way like it might be an animal. No, it is not just like being an animal so much as being like one of those malenky toys you viddy being sold in the streets, like little chellovecks made out of tin, with a spring inside and then a winding handle on the outside. And you wind it up, grrr grrr grrr and off it itties, like walking, O my brothers. But it itties in a straight line. And it bangs straight into things, bang bang. And it cannot help what it is doing. Being young is like being one of those malenky machines.\"",
    "And then at this point, the narrator starts going into this fantasy about having a son someday. And he says, \"When I had my son, I would like to explain all that to him, when he was starry enough to like understand. But then I knew he would not understand, or would not want to understand at all, and would do all the veshches I had done, yes perhaps even killing some poor starry forella surrounded with mewing kots and koshkas. And I would not be able to really stop him. And nor would he be able to stop his own son, brothers. And so it would itty on like that to the end of the world, round and round and round, like some bolshy, gigantic like chelloveck, like old Bog Himself, turning and turning and turning, a vonny grahzny orange in his gigantic rookers.\"",
    "Well, this episode of Your Radio Playhouse was produced by WBEZ Chicago with generous funding from the MacArthur Foundation. Editorial and production help from Paul Tough and Jack Hitt on the East Coast, Margy Rochlin on the West Coast, Dolores Wilber and Emily Hanford here in Chicago. It was Paul Tough who hooked up the program with all the computer hackers. The old gospel records today were courtesy of the amazing Steve Cushing and the Blues Before Sunrise radio network. Rob Newhouse helped produce our radio play. Special thanks, as always, to Torey Malatia. I\u0027m Ira Glass.",
