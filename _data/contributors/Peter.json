    "What are you doing?",
    "How many, Dondi?",
    "You can\u0027t have four. The most you can have is three.",
    "And two for the dealer.",
    "Call. What do you have?",
    "What do you guys think the worst sin is? Murder?",
    "Why do you say that?",
    "Really?",
    "I\u0027ll see that and raise you one.",
    "Me too.",
    "Huh? Oh, sure. Leave it over. Do you think a sin is worse if say you, for example, you betray somebody? Then suppose you don\u0027t feel any remorse. Does that make it worse?",
    "Wait a second, Dondi. Caleb, could I talk to you alone for a second, over there, by the window?",
    "No, I just wanted to talk, that\u0027s all.",
    "Nothing. Just I\u0027m afraid of going to hell.",
    "I just don\u0027t think I\u0027m a very good person.",
    "Yeah, but what if you do something bad? How bad does it have to be? I mean if-- do you have to-- if you feel like it\u0027s bad enough to damn you, are you damned? I mean, if you don\u0027t feel any remorse?",
    "Well--",
    "But being afraid of punishment isn\u0027t the same as remorse. Remorse is truly feeling apologetic for what you\u0027ve done, not just worrying about being punished for it.",
    "No.",
    "That\u0027s right.",
    "Thank you.",
    "I mean, what am I doing here? Who are these strange people? I don\u0027t remember deciding to come to Italy. What am I doing in Italy?",
    "Just last week, I was in France, in Rouen, the town where Joan of Arc was burned at the stake. And I was visiting the tower where she was held before her execution. And I was thinking about writing a letter, you know, apologizing. A letter apologizing to the injured party.",
    "I was looking down from the highest window in the tower. And just how you do-- you know, you try to tap into the place in yourself where you have truly apologetic feelings, because you want to be sincere. You don\u0027t want the letter to sound phony.",
    "Except I realized, I discovered that there was no such place in myself, that where that place should have been, there was just an empty hole. And it was frightening. It was like staring into the abyss.",
    "But you have to be repentant. I\u0027m not repentant.",
    "No. I\u0027d have to be truly sorry in my heart, or it wouldn\u0027t save me.",
    "What do you mean? I can\u0027t just pretend to have remorse.",
    "It\u0027s not a question of fooling the Pope.",
    "How did I get here? Why are we playing poker in Italy with a demonic little boy whose grandmother is dying in the next room?",
    "[PEACOCK CRY]",
    "What was that?",
    "[PEACOCK CRY]",
    "Huh. What\u0027s that a symbol of?",
    "It\u0027s golden, a golden peacock in the middle of a graveyard. I wonder what it means.",
    "Oh.",
    "Well, that\u0027s all right.",
    "Talk is cheap, gentlemen. 2 million lira.",
    "[PEACOCK CRY]",
    "Full house, aces and eights.",
    "See, if you had some where the numbers matched, or if they were in order, and there were five of them. But that, what you have there, that\u0027s nothing.",
    "My dad used to call it a Klondike.",
    "I don\u0027t blame you.",
    "[WAILING]",
    "My deal. Straight, five card draw.",
    "No.",
    "Sorry.",
    "Yeah-- yes, I have. How did you know?",
    "Call. Caleb, do you believe in sin?",
    "How can you believe in damnation but not sin?"
