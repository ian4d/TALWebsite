    "Who is your target audience?",
    "I\u0027m saying that you\u0027re in danger of appealing to a narrow range of listeners if it becomes a little too-- I don\u0027t know what word to use.",
    "Artsy, yeah.",
    "Now that Hugh Grant is such a big star, and everybody who sees you or sees your picture thinks how much you look like Hugh Grant, that fires up that TV thing again in me.",
    "Well, gosh, wouldn\u0027t they want this wonderful humanistic, intelligent reporter who looks like Hugh Grant?",
    "What\u0027s the theme for this week?",
    "That\u0027s very interesting, because I just did an interview this morning with a newspaper reporter about roman--",
    "--mance, romantic love. And people\u0027s expectations about relationships. And one of the things I believe is that there are a lot of people who are good at beginnings, but they\u0027re not good at middles.",
    "It means that they like the beginning, where there\u0027s all this idealization and romantic projections. And the other person can be who they think they should be, rather than who they are. And when they get to the middle phase--",
    "--where there\u0027s more of a reality-based relationship, they run away from it because it\u0027s not as exciting.",
    "So you are good at middles.",
    "That\u0027s good. That\u0027s good because practically all of life is the middle.",
    "Are we going to get a tape of this since we\u0027re outside the Chicago listening area?",
    "OK.",
    "Hello?",
    "Oh, hi, Ira.",
    "Fine. Can you hold on a second?",
    "Hi.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Yeah.",
    "What about?",
    "Hm. Do I have any advice? Well, can I ask another question?"
