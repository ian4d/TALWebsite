    "Title. Road. Treatment. It\u0027s shot entirely on video, mostly handheld. Shaky, out of focus, bad color. Overblown color actually. Sort of the way colors are separated on an old television console, yet still has all the outlines of the images repeated. The outlines of the images, the silhouettes, repeated over and over, ad nauseam, and fading into each other.",
    "Can I get this microphone adjusted a little, so I don\u0027t have to lean over so much?",
    "Check one, two, three. Sound better? Yeah. Sorry. Thanks.",
    "Synopsis. The story concerns Luke, gay, white, Midwestern, late twenties. Follows Luke on the day that he is informed of his HIV positive status. Luke cops a stance of cold, brittle, not unlike the Harrison Ford narration on Blade Runner, but there\u0027s a hint of vulnerability to Luke.",
    "Have we got the Harrison Ford or the Rutger Hauer voice?",
    "Great. Roll it.",
    "Great. Take it under me. That\u0027s great. Story follows Luke. He\u0027s accompanied by his college buddy, Bill, and both are packed for a road trip across the country to San Francisco.",
    "This isn\u0027t the right section of Blade Runner. Can you just kill the Blade Runner?",
    "Locations. Car interior. Gas station exterior. HIV clinic parking lot. HIV clinic interior. Highway. Music. Strauss\u0027s four last songs, particularly \"Ruhe, meine Seele!\" sung by Dame Janet Baker.",
    "Can you take it under me? Hold.",
    "Follows Luke and his friend Bill to the gas station and to the clinic, the last stop before getting on the highway.",
    "OK. Take it out. Take out the Janet Baker.",
    "Bill loads one hits of pot while driving on the way to the gas station and to the clinic.",
    "Can we nix that Strauss music? It\u0027s too mournful. There\u0027s really no music on the soundtrack. It\u0027s stark, crisp. Maybe some songs coming from the radio at the clinic\u0027s desk?",
    "[RADIO STATIC]",
    "Luke comments to Bill, \"Live entirely in the present, huh?\" Bill drives and looks out the corner of his right eye to see what position Luke is holding his head in. Luke looks outside passenger window and, every once in a while, turns to glance at Bill. Long pause. There\u0027s dead air. Cut to Luke\u0027s point of view. Car is pulling onto entrance ramp of highway. Luke sees hitchhiker with a sign that he stands for any remote meaning to the narrative. Luke sees himself outside of his own story. He can\u0027t read the hitchhiker\u0027s sign. He knows that he\u0027s on a long silent journey. He leans over to turn off the radio. Cut to black.",
